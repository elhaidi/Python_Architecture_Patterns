# Python_Architecture_Patterns
This project contains some real world code example that shows TDD, DDD and event driven microservices in action.

the first example will lay the foundation of what the evolution of the code will look like.

The whole project is divided by 2 parts:

1 - THe first one will involve building an architecture to support Domain modeling.

2 -  The secind one Event driven architecture
